# 💰 Finance Visualizer

Finance Visualizer is a **personal finance tracking web application** I built while learning full-stack development using the **MERN stack**.  
The idea behind this project was to move beyond tutorials and actually build something that connects the frontend, backend, and database together in a meaningful way.
